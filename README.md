# 3DGraphic_Project
Ideas for this project:

- An endless run game about a "humanoid" that has to avoid the covid/ill's people.
  The character has the possibility, colleting 3 vaccines, to be invincible for some time and faster.
  The aim is to make as many points as possible and maybe arrived at the end of the covid infection.
