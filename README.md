# 3DGraphic_Project
Ideas for this project:

An endless run game about a "humanoid" that has to avoid the covid virus and some obstacles on the ground.
Slowly the velocity of rotation of the world (and so the run animation) increase to make harder the game.
The character has the possibility, colleting 3 vaccines, to be invincible for some time and faster.
The aim is to make as many points as possible and maybe arrived at the end of the covid infection? 

- Understand how to have keyframe using tweenJS to make more step in a tween to have smoother animations.
  (otherwise make thousands of tween for the run animation)

- Add the function to create randomly on the world objects like wall(to avoid or jumpo over), covid ball, vaccine, ...

- Add the function of interception/collision , to make the objects tangible and stop the character (with collision function + physics??)

- Add physics?? (like rain covid ball, or rain strange objects like cube ecc.. ??)

- Add a button for start and stop for tween animation
  for the camera to show the world and the objects going around the scene in a smooth way

- Add control for lights and stuff (orbitControl for the camera already), maybe change the character color, ecc..

- Add the fucking Sun, associate with the sun DirectionalLight and rotate around the "street" (day and night).
  Moreover possibility to play at night with just SpotLights or in the morning with the sunLight.

- --- I hope to resolve the Tween animation situation, I'm a little stuck with that for now. ---
